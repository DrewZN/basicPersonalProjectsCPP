Just some basic personal projects written in C++

**bankingSystem** - Menu-driven banking / ATM system that allows for account creation/deletion, depositing/withdrawing, displaying balance, and saving/writing from database files.

**basicLoginSystem** - Menu-driven login system that allows for the creation and deletion of users. 'Saving to/Reading from file' system added (not 100% sure if it works yet).

**contactSystem** - Menu-driven contact management system that allows for the creation and deletion of phone contacts. Allows for searching for as well as editing individual contacts. Needs some bug-fixing (check todo)
